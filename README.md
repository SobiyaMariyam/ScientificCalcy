# Scientific Calculator in Java

This repository contains a fully functional **Scientific Calculator** developed in Java. The project features a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing, allowing users to perform a wide range of mathematical operations with ease. This calculator is ideal for students, educators, and developers as a reliable computational tool or a base for enhancements.

## Features

- **Basic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- **Trigonometric Functions:** Sine, cosine, tangent (in degrees).
- **Logarithmic Operations:** Natural log (`ln`) and base-10 log (`log`).
- **Power and Roots:** Square root, cube root, and power calculations.
- **Factorials:** Compute factorials of numbers.
- **Constants:** Access constants like Ï€ (pi) and `e`.
- **Error Handling:** Prevents invalid operations like division by zero.

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **GUI Framework:** Java Swing
